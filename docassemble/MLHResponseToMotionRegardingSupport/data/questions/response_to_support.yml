  To keep your address confidential, you need to have one of the following:

  * A Personal Protection Order or other order which keeps your address confidential, OR
  * On a [Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act Affidavit form](https://courts.michigan.gov/Administration/SCAO/Forms/courtforms/mc416.pdf),
    you need to state that you and/or your children’s safety would be at risk if you disclose your address.

  In either one of these scenarios, you can use a confidential address and phone number (such as the address and phone number
  of a friend or relative who has given their permission, or a Post Office Box) instead of your residential address and personal phone number.

question: |
  Amounts of child support in current order

id: finding support signpost
question: |
  Finding amount of support
subquestion: |
  Michigan child support orders are entered on a form called a Uniform Child Support Order.
  You can see how much of each type of support was ordered on the current Uniform Child Support Order.

  If you don’t have a copy of the Uniform Child Support Order,
  you can use the amounts ${ other_parties } included in the Motion Regarding Support if they are correct.
  To get a copy of the child support order, go to the circuit court clerk’s office or the Friend of the Court.

  ${ collapse_template(where_support_amounts) }
continue button field: finding_support_signpost
---
template: explain_costs
subject: |
  Can you explain these terms?
content: |
  **Base support** is the ordinary monthly child support amount for the general care and needs of a child.

  **Ordinary medical costs** are uninsured costs for things like office visits and prescription co-pays.

  **Child care costs** are used to allow a parent to work, look for work, or go to school. For most children, the child care obligation ends around age 12, but it may last longer if the child’s health or safety requires it.

id: changes requested signpost
question: |
  Telling the court to order child support
subquestion: |
  You will now be asked questions about how you want the court to order child support to be paid.

  You may ask the court for what you want, but the court will probably use the Michigan Child Support Formula to make its decision, so you may not get what you ask for.

  The Michigan Child Support Formula uses:

  * The parents' incomes
  * The number of nights per year (“overnights”) the children spend with each parent
  * The number of children
  * Medical costs
  * Child care costs
  * Other factors

  You can use the [MiChildSupport Calculator](https://micase.state.mi.us/calculatorapp/public/welcome/load.html) on the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website to find out what the support amount might be in your case.

id: how much child support signpost
question: |
  Telling the court how much child support to order
subquestion: |
  Child support normally includes a base amount, plus a percentage of medical costs and child care costs.

  The court must order support according to the Michigan Child Support Formula unless the result would be unfair. If the parents reach an agreement about the child support amount, the court can consider the agreement, but it does not have to order it.
