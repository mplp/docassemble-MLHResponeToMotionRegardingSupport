    you need to state that you and/or your children’s safety would be at risk if you disclose your address.

  In either one of these scenarios, you can use a confidential address and phone number (such as the address and phone number
  of a friend or relative who has given their permission, or a Post Office Box) instead of your residential address and personal phone number.

question: |
  Finding amount of support
subquestion: |
  Michigan child support orders are entered on a form called a Uniform Child Support Order.
  You can see how much of each type of support was ordered on the current Uniform Child Support Order.

  If you don’t have a copy of the Uniform Child Support Order,
  you can use the amounts ${ other_parties } included in the Motion Regarding Support if they are correct.
  To get a copy of the child support order, go to the circuit court clerk’s office or the Friend of the Court.

  ${ collapse_template(where_support_amounts) }
continue button field: finding_support_signpost
---
template: explain_costs
subject: |
  Can you explain these terms?
content: |
  **Base support** is the ordinary monthly child support amount for the general care and needs of a child.

  **Ordinary medical costs** are uninsured costs for things like office visits and prescription co-pays.

  **Child care costs** are used to allow a parent to work, look for work, or go to school. For most children, the child care obligation ends around age 12, but it may last longer if the child’s health or safety requires it.

id: changes requested signpost
question: |
  Telling the court to order child support
subquestion: |
  You will now be asked questions about how you want the court to order child support to be paid.

  You may ask the court for what you want, but the court will probably use the Michigan Child Support Formula to make its decision, so you may not get what you ask for.

  The Michigan Child Support Formula uses:

  * The parents' incomes
  * The number of nights per year (“overnights”) the children spend with each parent
  * The number of children
  * Medical costs
  * Child care costs
  * Other factors

  You can use the [MiChildSupport Calculator](https://micase.state.mi.us/calculatorapp/public/welcome/load.html) on the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website to find out what the support amount might be in your case.

id: how much child support signpost
question: |
  Telling the court how much child support to order
subquestion: |
  Child support normally includes a base amount, plus a percentage of medical costs and child care costs.

  The court must order support according to the Michigan Child Support Formula unless the result would be unfair. If the parents reach an agreement about the child support amount, the court can consider the agreement, but it does not have to order it.

# TODO(brycew): copied from LHI, adjust text to what's actually in our form
id: efile note question
question: |
  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.
  If you are e-filing, you must use [MiFILE](https://mifile.courts.michigan.gov/).
  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.
  This means that you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need.

  You will be able to get all forms you need by clicking the Download Your Form(s) button on the page at the end of this tool.
  You will then see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them.

  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)

question: |
  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.

  If you plan to e-file, you may want to add your electronic signature, otherwise you will need to print your forms, sign them by hand, and then scan them.
